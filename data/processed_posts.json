I get nervous easily\u2026 you\u2019re the only one who makes me feel calm \ud83e\udd7a'\n\nHe started learning SQL and how to impress future in-laws. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nShe sent selfies like:\n'How do I look for the Zoom interview? \ud83d\udc57\ud83d\udc84'\n\nBro said, 'Perfect. You look perfect. For the job. And\u2026 for life.'\n(He even ironed his shirt.

She\u2019s everything this company needs.\u2019\n\nHR reluctantly agreed.\n\nShe got the job.\nHe got played.\n\nAnd 3 days after she joined, she said:\n'I\u2019m really focusing on myself right now\u2026 also I\u2019ve started seeing someone else. Hope we can still be good friends :)'\n\nGOOD FRIENDS??\nMa\u2019am you just used his heart like a step-ladder to climb the corporate stairs. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nNow she shares posts on LinkedIn:\n\u2018Manifestation works.
