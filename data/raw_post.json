You’re sooo cool 😍 also… are there any openings at your company?'\n\nThat 'heyy' with two y’s? Fatal.\nThat 😍 emoji? Career-ending.\n\nMy man was already planning date destinations. 😭\nShe started calling him late at night:\n'Can you help me prepare for the interview? I get nervous easily… you’re the only one who makes me feel calm 🥺'\n\nHe started learning SQL and how to impress future in-laws. 😭\n\nShe sent selfies like:\n'How do I look for the Zoom interview? 👗💄'\n\nBro said, 'Perfect. You look perfect. For the job. And… for life.'\n(He even ironed his shirt. For her interview.) 🤡\n\nHe went full Ranbir Kapoor for her.\nWrote a long email to HR:\n‘She’s different. She’s passionate. She’s everything this company needs.’\n\nHR reluctantly agreed.\n\nShe got the job.\nHe got played.\n\nAnd 3 days after she joined, she said:\n'I’m really focusing on myself right now… also I’ve started seeing someone else. Hope we can still be good friends :)'\n\nGOOD FRIENDS??\nMa’am you just used his heart like a step-ladder to climb the corporate stairs. 😭\n\nNow she shares posts on LinkedIn:\n‘Manifestation works. Believe in yourself ❤️’\n\nMeanwhile, my friend’s only manifestation is HR rejecting her appraisal next year. 😤\n\nLessons learned:\n'You’re sooo helpful' = 'Thanks, servant.'\n\nIf someone sends you a selfie before the interview, run.\n\nNever fall for a candidate who uses both emojis and tears as strategy.\nLinkedIn is for referrals, not romance.\n\nAnd HR doesn’t approve emotional reimbursements.",
